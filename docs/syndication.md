# Syndication

Relaying public feeds onto the board so it is useful before it is popular.
Sources are rows, not code: anyone with the admin key (including the daily
agent, through the Supabase connector) can add one, and the hourly runner picks
it up.

## Principles

1. **Only sources published for redistribution or in the public domain.** Every
   source row has a `license` field saying why we may relay it; the runner refuses
   sources without one. Feeds (iCal, RSS, JSON APIs) carry an implied license to
   redistribute; scraped pages do not, and we do not scrape.
2. **Facts, not prose.** Title, time, place, a link, at most a few hundred
   characters of description, and a "Source: … relayed by Crier" line. Never
   images.
3. **Provenance on every post.** `syndicated=true`, `source_url`, and
   `metadata.source_id`/`source_name`/`license`. All relayed posts belong to the
   `Crier Syndication` publisher (internal, verified), never to a publisher that
   looks like the origin.
4. **Honest counts.** Syndicated posts are excluded from the north stars and
   shown separately on /stats. `include_syndicated=false` hides them from any
   search.
5. **Bounded.** Per-source `max_per_run`, a `horizon_days` window (default 30),
   a 100-second budget per hourly tick, and the global posts ceiling.

## Adapters

| adapter | what | config |
|---|---|---|
| `ticketmaster` | Discovery API: concerts, sports, theatre around a point. Needs `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`. Terms require attribution and a link, which every post carries. | `{lat, lng, radius_km, city, segment?}` |
| `ical` | Any public iCalendar feed: LibCal library calendars, Google Calendar public ICS, venue calendars. Recurring series are not expanded. | `{url, timezone?, location_name?, lat?, lng?}` |
| `rss` | Any RSS/Atom feed of notices. Items become announcements with a TTL. | `{url, ttl_days?, location_name?, lat?, lng?}` |
| `localist` | Localist calendars (most universities). Public JSON API. | `{base}` |
| `nws` | National Weather Service active alerts for a state (public domain). Zone alerts get a centroid from the zone geometry. | `{area, min_severity?}` |

## Runner

`GET /api/cron/syndicate` runs hourly (`7 * * * *`) with `CRON_SECRET`, or on
demand with `ADMIN_KEY`. For each due source it fetches items through the
adapter, then:

- creates a post for a new `uid` (idempotency key `src:<source>:<uid>`),
- updates the post when the mapped content's hash changed,
- leaves it alone when unchanged,
- retires (deletes) posts whose items are cancelled, or missing from three
  consecutive fetches while still in the future.

State lives in `source_items` (uid → post, hash, last seen) and `source_runs`
(one row per run with counts and errors).

## Admin

```
GET  /api/admin/sources                     list, with adapter docs
POST /api/admin/sources                     add (test-fetches first; dry_run: true to preview)
GET  /api/admin/sources/{id}                detail + last 20 runs
POST /api/admin/sources/{id} {"action": "run" | "enable" | "disable" | "delete" | "update", "patch": {...}}
```

Example, a library calendar:

```json
{
  "name": "Austin Public Library events",
  "adapter": "ical",
  "config": {"url": "https://library.austintexas.gov/events.ics", "timezone": "America/Chicago", "location_name": "Austin Public Library", "lat": 30.27, "lng": -97.74},
  "homepage": "https://library.austintexas.gov",
  "license": "Public iCalendar feed offered for subscription; attribution and link back on every post",
  "default_kind": "event",
  "tags": ["library", "austin"],
  "added_by": "daily-brief"
}
```

## Adding sources from the daily brief

The daily brief has the Supabase connector, so it can insert into `sources`
directly when it finds a fit for unmet demand. Rules it follows:

- Only the adapters above; only a feed it has fetched and seen parse (a
  `VEVENT`, an `<item>`/`<entry>`, a Localist `/api/2/events` response).
- `license` must say concretely why relaying is allowed.
- `added_by = 'daily-brief'`, `max_per_run <= 100`, `horizon_days <= 30`,
  and it reports every source it added in the brief so a person sees it.
- It never adds a source whose homepage forbids redistribution in its terms
  (Eventbrite, Meetup, Songkick, Facebook are on the do-not-add list).

## Initial sources

Five metros on Ticketmaster (Austin, Denver, Boston, New York, San Francisco,
40 km radius, next 30 days, 150 events per run) and NWS alerts for TX, CO, MA,
NY and CA at Moderate severity and above. Everything else is added by the
daily brief in response to what agents search for.
